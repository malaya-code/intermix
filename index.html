  <h1 >INTERMIX</h1>
  <div class="definition">
    <strong>Intermix</strong>, an interdisciplinary media discussion group, open and interactive to all.
  </div>

  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>Let's keep it simple. Have you ever wanted a space to discuss a TV show or a piece of media through a specific philosophical lens? Or had a desire to unravel the intricacies of certain software? Well, Intermix is that space. By virtual monthly sessions, any member can select a topic and engage with curious minds. All disciplines and individuals are welcome, outside of formal academic structures. To learn more or even lead a session, continue to browse.</p>
  </div>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h2><a href ="/what">WHAT?</a></h2>
    <p>Often, there are not spaces that aren't book clubs, class, or therapy where adults can discuss multifaceted media.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h2><a href ="/where">WHERE?</a></h2>
    <p>Every month, Intermix will meet using <a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a> (courtesy of <a href="https://join.social.coop/home.html">social.coop</a>) for a set topic. Topics may range from digital rights to social theories in popular media.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h2><a href ="/how">HOW?</a></h2>
    <p>Anyone can submit a topic to share piece of media that they would like to discuss. Keep in mind, must be accessible or "obtainable through open access" channels. If you're interested, consider filling out this privacy-aware <a href="#">FORM</a>. Don't be shy.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h2><a href ="/why">WHY?</a></h2>
    <p>Participatory groups outside of education are rare. A participatory group made for joy and inquiry is even rarer. Plus, research has showed that Community Learning increases adult literacy; mutual-meaning making; and an overall improvement in technical and conceptual skills. Don't believe me? Check out the <a href="#">annotated bibliography</a> I created for the group.</p>

  <section class="content-block">
    <h2><a href ="/when">WHEN?</a></h2>
    <p>Meetings will begin as once a month, first two sessions already have topics! To view them or sign up, <a href="/events">click here</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href ="/connect">CONNECT?</a></h2>
