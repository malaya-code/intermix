co-facilitating a session.

<h2 id="accessibility-for-everyone-inside-and-outside-of-academia">Accessibility for Everyone</h2>
<h3>(inside and outside of academia)</h3>
&nbsp;

Intermix is a discussion group for adults interested in engaging with
media and ideas across different disciplines.

&nbsp;

Participation does not require academic credentials or prior
expertise. Sessions are designed to be accessible to people with varied
backgrounds, experience levels, and approaches to learning.

&nbsp;

The goal is to make participation feel possible without requiring
performance, self-justification, or demonstrations of knowledge.


<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>Each session centers on a single piece of media chosen by one
participant.</li>
 	<li>Discussion may include analysis, reaction, questioning, or
contextual exploration.</li>
 	<li>A range of interpretations and viewpoints is expected.</li>
 	<li>Participants may engage actively, minimally, or primarily through
listening.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="what-is-not-expected-here">What Not To Expected Here</h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>Academic training or formal disciplinary background</li>
 	<li>Prior familiarity with the material</li>
 	<li>Agreement or consensus</li>
 	<li>A specific level or style of participation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="guiding-principles-for-interaction">Guiding Principles for Interaction</h2>
&nbsp;

Intermix values engagement that is thoughtful, respectful, and
grounded in shared curiosity.

&nbsp;

Participants are expected to treat differences in knowledge,
background, or experience with care. Dismissive or belittling behavior
is not acceptable.

&nbsp;

Boundaries should be respected when stated. Critique, correction, or
advice should be offered only when invited and should remain focused on
ideas rather than individuals.


<h2 id="what-is-not-okay-here">What Is Not Okay Here</h2>
&nbsp;

Harassment, bullying, or discriminatory behavior is not
tolerated. This includes behavior that targets or excludes participants based on
identity, background, discipline, or perceived level of knowledge.

&nbsp;

Conduct that undermines a respectful discussion environment may
result in removal from the space.


<h2 id="questions">Questions?</h2>
&nbsp;

criticism? You can email <strong>intermix[underscore]club@proton[dot]me</strong>.
