<div class="bib-text">

Brookfield and Preskill define discussion as a structured, reflective exchange of views in which participants articulate reasoning and respond to others’ ideas. <em>Way of Teaching: Tools and Techniques for Democratic Classrooms</em> discussions are distinguished from casual conversation through critical engagement with ideas. Critical discussion involves a willingness to revise positions when warranted and firmness when arguments are unconvincing.

The chapter establishes a theoretical basis for Intermix as a participant-led reflective space. Intermix is cemented in shared inquiry and interpretation across media rather than instruction or consensus. When dealing with diverse peoples and perspectives, maintaining a supportive yet engaging learning environment is central. Brookfield and Preskill’s documentation of critical discussions supports framework Intermix will follow.

<p class="bib-citation"><strong>D’Ignazio, Catherine, and Lauren F. Klein.</strong> “Why Data Science Needs Feminism.” Introduction to <em>Data Feminism</em>. MIT Press, 2020.</p>

<div class="bib-text">

<em>Data Feminism</em> outlines how bias enters data systems and technology through social, political, and institutional decisions. D’Ignazio and Klein ground this argument in lived experience, including the story of, Christine Mann Darden, Woman of Color who earned a Master’s degree in applied math in 1967. Darden's experiences illustrates how labor and insight have long existed outside dominant narratives in computer science. Throughout the chapter, the authors argues that analyzing data without examining the structures that produce it reproduces inequality rather than neutrality.

The inclusion of this source was paramount, as critical analysis requires careful, contextual engagement with media and information. Intermix encourages interpretation, reflection, and shared discussion; intersectionality as shown through Darden's story, is vital for multimodal discourse.

<p class="bib-citation"><strong>Donohoo, Jenni.</strong> <em>Collaborative Inquiry for Educators: A Facilitator’s Guide to School Improvement.</em> Corwin Press, 2011.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071939062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://doi.org/10.4135/9781071939062</a>.</p>

<div class="bib-text">

Donohoo is an educational researcher and learning facilitator with extensive experience in collaborative, inquiry-based learning environments. Her work builds on earlier frameworks, including Katz’s discussion of skill development in group settings; the focus shifts to inquiry as a shared process rather than an individual task. Although written for school contexts, the book explains how groups refine ideas and develop understanding through participation.

For Intermix, the book helps explain how meaning-making develops through group process. Intermix functions as a participatory, multimodal space where people bring materials and reflect together; learning emerges through shared discussion rather than instruction. Donohoo’s framework supports participant-led media exploration as a way to strengthen collaboration and reflective practice outside formal educational settings.

<p class="bib-citation"><strong>Katz, Robert L.</strong> “Skills of an Effective Administrator.” <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, 33 (1955): 33–42. Reprinted 1974.</p>

<div class="bib-text">

Katz’s article, published in <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, offers a framework for understanding effective participation in group settings, even outside business contexts. Intermix is not a workplace or management space, but the article remains useful because it identifies three skills that shape how people contribute in groups: technical, interpersonal, and conceptual.

Katz’s framework is useful resource, because it treats participation as something people learn by doing, rather than as a fixed role or credential. The article shows how contributing to a group requires preparation, communication, and interpretation working together; this compliments Intermix acutely, as participants build skill through shared attention and discussion rather than formal instruction. Katz explains why structured conversation can strengthen individual confidence over time.

<p class="bib-citation"><strong>New London Group.</strong> “A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures.” <em>Harvard Educational Review</em> 66, no. 1 (1996): 60–92.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://doi.org/10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u</a>.</p>

<div class="bib-text">

What are multiliteracies and how can adults interact with this concept? The New London Group describes multiliteracy in an academic context and explains how the emergence of the digital age and multifaceted media requires a multifaceted approach to literacy. The authors argue that traditional models of literacy are too narrow and no longer reflect how people actually make meaning.

Although this article was published in 1996, it reflects many social realities that still exist today. These include the rise of new media types, political and geopolitical tensions, and the continued emergence of new technologies. Intermix aims to be multiliterate and participatory. This means participants are encouraged to engage with different forms of media and experience varying cultural concepts. This source is cited because it provides a scholarly foundation for treating multimodal participation as legitimate, meaningful, and accessible to adults outside formal academic settings.

Although published in 1996, the text remains relevant today. It addresses the rise of new media types, political and geopolitical tensions, and ongoing technological change. Intermix aims to be multiliterate and participatory; participants engage with different forms of media and diverse cultural concepts. This source is cited because it provides a scholarly foundation for treating multimodal participation as meaningful avenues to access adult literacy.
